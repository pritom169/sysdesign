## Latency and Performance


Latency and performance are critical aspects of distributed systems, as they directly impact the user experience and the system's ability to handle large amounts of data and traffic.

### A. Data Locality

Data locality refers to the organization and distribution of data within a distributed system to minimize the amount of data that needs to be transferred between nodes. By storing related data close together or near the nodes that access it most frequently, you can reduce the latency associated with data retrieval and improve overall performance. Techniques to achieve data locality include data partitioning, sharding, and data replication.

### B. Load Balancing

Load balancing is the process of distributing incoming network traffic or computational workload across multiple nodes or resources to ensure that no single node is overwhelmed.

### C. Caching Strategies

Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data or computed results temporarily, allowing the system to quickly retrieve the data from cache instead of recalculating or fetching it from the primary data source.
