## Load Balancing

### Introduction to Load Balancing

Load balancing is a crucial component of System Design, as it helps distribute incoming requests and traffic evenly across multiple servers. The main goal of load balancing is to ensure high availability, reliability, and performance by avoiding overloading a single server and avoiding downtime.

Typically a load balancer sits between the client and the server accepting incoming network and application traffic and distributing the traffic across multiple backend servers using various algorithms. By balancing application requests across multiple servers, a load balancer reduces the load on individual servers and prevents any one server from becoming a single point of failure, thus improving overall application availability and responsiveness.

    %% Define the "Client" group with three user nodes
    subgraph Client_Group [Client]
        C1[User 1]
        C2[User 2]
        C3[User 3]
    end

    %% Define the Internet node
    I([Internet])

    %% Define the Load Balancer node
    LB[Load Balancer]

    %% Define the "Servers" group with four server nodes
    subgraph Server_Group [Servers]
        S1[Server 1]
        S2[Server 2]
        S3[Server 3]
        S4[Server 4]
    end

    %% Define the connections (flow)
    C1 --> I
    C2 --> I
    C3 --> I
    I --> LB
    LB --> S1
    LB --> S2
    LB --> S3
    LB --> S4
